=> HTTP Smuggling

- HTTP request smuggling is a web application vulnerability that occurs when there is an inconsistency in the way front-end and back-end servers interpret the boundaries of HTTP requests. This misalignment allows an attacker to "smuggle" a malicious request through, often bypassing security filters or controls.
- HTTP Smuggling is a web vulnerability that occurs when proxies and web servers parse HTTP requests differently, allowing attackers to "smuggle" a hidden request through a trusted front-end.
- Most HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise because the HTTP/1 specification provides two different ways to specify where a request ends: the Content-Length header and the Transfer-Encoding header.
- HTTP Smuggling can be mitigated by ensuring consistent HTTP parsing across components, blocking conflicting headers (Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding), using HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, and regularly testing and updating your infrastructure.

How It Works:
- Request smuggling typically happens in multi-tier architectures, such as:
    - A front-end proxy (e.g., reverse proxy, load balancer, CDN),
    - A back-end web server or application server.
- The issue arises when the front-end and back-end disagree on:
    - How to determine the end of one HTTP request and the start of the next.
    - This often involves conflicting headers such as:
        - Content-Length
        - Transfer-Encoding: chunked
- Using Both is Invalid per RFC

Headers:
- Content-Length:
    - Tells the server exactly how many bytes of data are in the HTTP request (or response) body.
    - Used when:
        - The body is sent as one continuous block of bytes.
        - The server needs to know where the request ends.
- Transfer-Encoding:
    - Tells the server how the message body is encoded or broken up before it is sent.
    - Transfer-Encoding: chunked means: The body is split into multiple chunks, each with its own length, and ends with a chunk of size 0.

Techniques:
- CL.TE (Content-Length vs Transfer-Encoding)
    - What happens:
        - Front-end uses Content-Length
        - Back-end uses Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    - Exploit idea:
        - An attacker sends both headers.
        - Each server interprets the request body differently, causing part of it to be treated as a second (smuggled) request.
    - Example:
        POST / HTTP/1.1
        Content-Length: 13
        Transfer-Encoding: chunked

        0

        GET /admin HTTP/1.1
- TE.CL (Transfer-Encoding vs Content-Length)
    - What happens:
        - Front-end uses Transfer-Encoding: chunked
        - Back-end uses Content-Length
    - Exploit idea:
        - Chunked body ends early for front-end, but back-end keeps reading extra data as another request.
    - Example:
        POST / HTTP/1.1
        Transfer-Encoding: chunked
        Content-Length: 50

        0

        GET /secret HTTP/1.1
- TE.TE (Transfer-Encoding confusion)
    - What happens:
        - Both servers support Transfer-Encoding, but parse it differently.
    - Common tricks - Obfuscated headers:
        - Transfer-Encoding : chunked
        - Transfer-Encoding: xchunked
        - Multiple TE headers
    - Exploit idea:
        - One server ignores malformed TE, the other accepts it → desync.
- CL.CL (Multiple Content-Length)
    - What happens:
        - Two different Content-Length headers are sent.
    - Exploit idea:
        - Front-end uses first value
        - Back-end uses second value
        - This mismatch allows hidden request injection.
    - Example:
        Content-Length: 10
        Content-Length: 40
- HTTP/2 → HTTP/1 Desync Smuggling
    - Modern variation when:
        - Client uses HTTP/2
        - Proxy converts to HTTP/1.1
    - Differences in:
        - Header normalization
        - Line breaks
        - Length handling
        - can allow smuggling even without classic CL/TE tricks.
- Method-based smuggling
    - Using unusual methods:
        - HEAD
        - OPTIONS
        - TRACE
    - combined with body handling quirks to desync parsing.

Exploitation Impact:
- Bypass authentication or WAFs by hiding malicious payloads.
- Hijack user sessions by injecting requests that get processed in someone else’s context.
- Cache poisoning, leading to the serving of attacker-controlled content to other users.
- Cross-user attacks, like credential theft or forced requests.

HTTP/2 Considerations:
- While request smuggling is traditionally associated with HTTP/1.1, it can still affect HTTP/2 environments if:
- HTTP/2 is converted (downgraded) to HTTP/1.1 by a reverse proxy.
- Improper request reassembly allows smuggling via stream mismanagement or header abuse.

Mitigations:
- Use consistent and strict parsing logic between front-end and back-end.
- Avoid mixing Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers.
- Normalize and validate incoming requests at the perimeter.
- Keep web server software up to date with security patches.

Testing Vulnerability:
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: test.com

Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

GET / HTTP/1.1

Exploiting Vulnerability:
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: test.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
5e
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15
x=1

HTTP Request Smuggling CL.TE (Content-Length + Transfer-Encoding) Steps:
- Step 1: Malicious request is sent: The attacker sends an HTTP request containing both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding: chunked headers, with the Content-Length set to a small value and a larger chunked body that includes a smuggled second request.
- Step 2: Front-end parses using Content-Length: The front-end (e.g., a proxy or load balancer) trusts the Content-Length header and reads only the specified number of bytes from the request body, ignoring the rest and considering the request complete.
- Step 3: Back-end parses using Transfer-Encoding: The back-end server trusts the Transfer-Encoding: chunked header instead, and continues reading the entire chunked body, interpreting the leftover data (which the front-end ignored) as a second, valid HTTP request.
- Step 4: Desynchronization and smuggling occur: As a result, the front-end and back-end become desynchronized, allowing the attacker to smuggle a hidden request past front-end security checks and directly into the back-end server, potentially bypassing authentication, filters, or logging.
