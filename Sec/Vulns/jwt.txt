=> JSON Web Token (JWT)

- A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It's commonly used in authentication and authorization in web applications.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are widely used for authentication and authorization in web applications. However, they can be vulnerable to several types of attacks if not properly implemented.

Structure of JWT:
- A JWT has three parts, separated by dots: <Header>.<Payload>.<Signature>
- Example: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIn0.dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk
- 1. Header: Specifies metadata like the algorithm used:
    {
        "alg": "HS256",
        "typ": "JWT"
    }
- 2. Payload: Contains the actual data (claims):
    {
        "userId": 123,
        "role": "admin",
        "exp": 1718280000
    }
- 3. Signature: Used to verify the integrity of the token:
    HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)

Authentication:
- User logs in -> Server generates JWT.
- JWT is sent to the client (browser/mobile).
- Client stores JWT (in localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies).
- Client includes JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token> header for each request.
- Server verifies JWT signature and allows/denies access.

JWT Can Be Vulnerable:
JWTs themselves are not insecure, but incorrect implementation can make them vulnerable. Here’s why:
- Insecure Algorithm Usage: Using alg: none or misusing HS256/RS256 leads to signature bypass.
- Weak Secret Keys: If a weak secret is used (e.g., "password"), attackers can brute-force it.
- No Expiry or Revocation: JWTs are often stateless, so once issued, they stay valid until expiration.- compromised, they can’t be revoked easily unless you maintain a token blacklist.
- Stored in Client-Side: Storing JWTs in localStorage makes them vulnerable to XSS attacks.- red cookies are vulnerable to CSRF if not set with SameSite=Strict or HttpOnly.
- Tampered Claims: If claims like admin: true are not validated server-side, they can be manipulated.
- Trusting JWT Without Verification: If the server skips signature verification, any token is treated as valid.

JWT attacks
- None Algorithm Attack
    Cause: Misconfiguration allowing alg: none in the token.
    Attack: Attacker removes the signature and sets the algorithm to none. If the server accepts it, the attacker can forge a valid token.
- Algorithm Confusion Attack (HS256 to RS256)
    Cause: JWT supports both symmetric (HS256) and asymmetric (RS256) algorithms.
    Attack: If server uses RS256 but treats public key as HMAC secret, attacker can sign token with HS256 using public key as secret.
- Key Injection / Key Confusion
    Cause: Poor key handling.
    Attack: Attacker supplies their own public key in the JWT header (e.g., jwk or x5u) and the server mistakenly uses it to verify the token.
- Expired Token Replay
    Cause: No proper expiration checks or replay prevention.
    Attack: Attacker uses a previously valid token to gain unauthorized access.
- Token Replay Attack
    Cause: Same token accepted multiple times.
    Attack: If a token is intercepted, it can be reused on other endpoints without restriction.
- Brute Force / Weak Secret Attack
    Cause: JWT signed with a weak secret (HS256).
    Attack: Attacker brute-forces the secret key and forges valid tokens.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal JWT
    Cause: XSS vulnerability in frontend.
    Attack: Steal JWT stored in localStorage/sessionStorage or cookies using malicious scripts.
- Improper Token Revocation
    Cause: No mechanism to revoke tokens.
    Attack: Even after logout or access removal, old tokens may still work.
- Replay with Refresh Token
    Cause: Refresh tokens are not bound to user session or IP.
    Attack: Attacker uses stolen refresh token to get a new JWT and maintain access.
- JWT Injection / Tampering
    Cause: No proper validation of claims like sub, iss, aud.
    Attack: Attacker tampers with claims to impersonate another user or gain elevated privileges.
