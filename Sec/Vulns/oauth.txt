=> OAuth

- OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords. OAuth lets users authorize third-party apps to access their resources (e.g., email, profile, calendar) on another service (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub) without sharing their credentials.
- This allows the app to access certain user data from Google/Facebook, like your email address or profile info, without asking for your Google password.
- In simple terms: OAuth lets you log in to one app using another account, like: “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook”
- Example: You click "Login with Google" on a website — OAuth handles that securely.

Key Components of OAuth 2.0:
- Resource Owner: The user who owns the data.
- Client: The app requesting access to the user’s data.
- Authorization Server: The server that authenticates the user and issues access tokens (e.g., Google, GitHub).
- Resource Server: The server hosting the user's data (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub APIs).
- Access Token: A temporary credential issued to the client to access the user’s data.

How OAuth Works (OAuth 2.0 flow):
- There are different flows (or "grant types"), but the most common is the Authorization Code Flow:Basic Actors:
    - Resource Owner: You (the user)
    - Client: The third-party app (e.g., Spotify)
    - Authorization Server: Google/Facebook (who authenticates user)
    - Resource Server: Hosts protected user data (e.g., Google APIs)
- Step-by-Step Flow:
    - Client redirects user to Authorization Server for login.
    - User logs in and grants permission.
    - Authorization Server redirects back with an authorization code.
    - Client exchanges code for an access token from the Authorization Server.
    - Client uses access token to access user data on the Resource Server.

Common OAuth Vulnerabilities:
- Misconfigured Redirect URIs:
    - Attacker tricks the server into redirecting to a malicious site with the token/code.
    - Exploit: Open Redirect -> Token Leak
- CSRF in OAuth Flow:
    - Attacker forces user to authorize attacker’s app.
    - If the client app doesn't verify state, attacker gets access.
- Token Leakage via Referrer:
    - Access tokens may leak via URL (in logs, referrer headers).
- Authorization Code Interception:
    - If the client app uses an insecure channel (e.g., HTTP), code can be intercepted.
- Client Impersonation:
    - If the client secret is leaked, attacker can impersonate the client.
- Using Implicit Flow:
    - Deprecated for SPAs because tokens are exposed in the URL.

Mitigate OAuth Vulnerabilities:
- Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange):
    - Replaces the need for client secret in mobile or SPA.
    - Prevents interception attacks.
- Validate Redirect URIs:
    - Pre-register exact URIs.
    - Don’t allow wildcards or open redirects.
- Use state parameter:
    - Random value to tie request and response.
    - Prevents CSRF.
- Always Use HTTPS:
    - Prevents MITM attacks.
- Don't Store Tokens in URL:
    - Use HTTP headers or cookies.
    - Avoid implicit flow in SPAs.
- Use short-lived tokens and refresh tokens:
    - Reduces token abuse risk.
- Use Scopes:
    - Limit access based on what the client needs.
    - e.g., read-only vs full-access
